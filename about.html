            <h2>The <span id="green-heading">community</span></h2>
            <p>There were a few groups that were living in Whanganui. There were the Hinengāku that belonged to the upper river, Tama Ūpoko of the middle and Tūpoho of the lower. The tribes of Whanganui take their name and their strength from the river. The river is their primary source of travel, and a source of physical and spiritual sustenance. The customary use by tangata whenua (people of the land) of indigenous species of the ecosystem is essential in the maintenance of their culture and tradition.

The people residing in the lower part of the River began to trade with the town, and many were converted to Christianity as they were exposed to the settlers and their customs. This lead to the Māori’s strengthing their beliefs and traditions in order to keep their customs prevalent. The Whanganui National Park was established in 1987 to protect the forest and land and the community still resides there. </p>

            <p>Whanganui River is sacrad to Māori people and considers it as a living being. The river is considered a living being under New Zealand’s law. The legal battle started more than 140 years ago and the Māori community celebrates this victory. </p>
